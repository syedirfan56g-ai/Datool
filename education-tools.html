                <div style="background: #f8f9fa; padding: 25px; border-radius: 15px; margin-bottom: 30px;">
                    <h4 style="color: #667eea; margin-bottom: 15px;">AP Biology Score Calculator</h4>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Our AP Biology score calculator is meticulously crafted based on the latest College Board scoring guidelines. Students can input their multiple-choice section scores (out of 69 questions) and their free response question scores across six different prompts. The calculator provides weighted scoring that mirrors the actual AP exam structure, giving students a realistic prediction of their final score from 1 to 5.</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">This tool is invaluable for students who want to track their progress throughout their AP Biology course, identify areas needing improvement, and set realistic goals for the actual exam. Teachers can also use this calculator to help students understand the scoring process and motivate them towards achieving their target scores.</p>
                    
                    <h4 style="color: #667eea; margin-bottom: 15px;">AP Chemistry Score Calculator</h4>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Similar in sophistication to our Biology calculator, the AP Chemistry tool accounts for the unique structure of the Chemistry exam. With separate scoring for multiple-choice questions and seven free response questions of varying point values, this calculator provides students with accurate score predictions based on their performance patterns.</p>
                    
                    <p>The calculator helps students understand the relationship between different section performances and their overall score, enabling more strategic study planning and exam preparation.</p>

                <h3 style="color: #764ba2; margin-bottom: 20px;">‚öæ Sports Analytics Tools</h3>
                <div style="background: #f8f9fa; padding: 25px; border-radius: 15px; margin-bottom: 30px;">
                    <h4 style="color: #667eea; margin-bottom: 15px;">ERA Calculator</h4>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">The Earned Run Average (ERA) calculator is essential for baseball students, coaches, and sports analytics enthusiasts. ERA is one of the most important statistics for evaluating pitcher performance, calculated using the formula: (Earned Runs √ó 9) √∑ Innings Pitched. This standardized metric allows for fair comparison between pitchers regardless of how many innings they've pitched.</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Our calculator handles fractional innings (like 6‚Öî innings) and provides instant, accurate calculations. It's perfect for high school and college baseball programs, sports journalism students, and anyone involved in baseball statistics analysis. The tool also explains the significance of different ERA ranges, helping users understand what constitutes excellent, good, or poor pitching performance.</p>
                    
                    <p>Beyond basic calculation, the tool serves as an educational resource, explaining how ERA fits into the broader context of baseball analytics and its importance in player evaluation and team strategy.</p>

                    <h4 style="color: #667eea; margin-bottom: 15px;">Crosswind Calculator</h4>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Aviation safety depends on accurate wind component calculations, and our crosswind calculator provides the precision needed for safe flight operations. This tool calculates both crosswind and headwind/tailwind components based on wind speed, wind direction, and runway heading using trigonometric principles.</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Aviation students use this calculator to understand wind effects on aircraft performance, plan safe approaches and departures, and develop skills in flight planning. The tool is designed to mirror real-world aviation scenarios, helping students bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application.</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">The calculator also serves as a valuable training aid for understanding vector mathematics in aviation contexts, reinforcing concepts taught in aviation ground school and meteorology courses. Flight instructors often use similar tools to demonstrate the practical importance of wind calculations in flight safety.</p>
                    
                    <p>By providing instant, accurate calculations, students can focus on understanding the principles and applications rather than spending time on manual computations, enhancing their overall learning experience.</p>
