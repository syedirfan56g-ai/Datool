            <h2 style="color: #667eea; margin-bottom: 30px;">Empowering Learning and Financial Literacy</h2>
            
            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px; font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7;">Datools was founded on the belief that high-quality educational and financial calculators should be accessible to everyone, regardless of economic circumstances or geographic location. We're passionate about creating tools that empower students, educators, and professionals to make informed decisions and achieve their academic and financial goals.</p>

            <div style="margin-bottom: 40px;">
                <h3 style="color: #764ba2; margin-bottom: 20px;">üéØ Our Mission</h3>
                <div style="background: #f8f9fa; padding: 25px; border-radius: 15px; margin-bottom: 30px;">
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Our mission is to democratize access to professional-grade computational tools by providing free, accurate, and user-friendly calculators for education and finance. We believe that quality tools shouldn't be locked behind paywalls or limited by subscription models that create barriers to access.</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Every student deserves accurate AP score calculators to track their progress. Every family should have access to living wage calculators for financial planning. Every professional should be able to perform complex financial calculations without expensive software. This philosophy drives everything we do at Datools.</p>
                    
                    <p>We're committed to maintaining our tools as free resources while continuously improving their accuracy, functionality, and user experience. Our success is measured not by profit margins, but by the positive impact we have on our users' educational and financial journeys.</p>

This understanding drives the user-centered design philosophy that makes Datools calculators both powerful and intuitive.</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Having witnessed firsthand the challenges that students and families face when trying to access quality educational resources, Syed was motivated to create tools that eliminate financial barriers while maintaining professional-grade accuracy and functionality.</p>
                    
                    <p>"I believe that access to quality educational and financial tools shouldn't depend on your ability to pay subscription fees. Every student, teacher, and family deserves access to accurate calculators that can help them make better decisions." - Syed Afnan SAV</p>

                    <h4 style="color: #667eea; margin-bottom: 15px;">Quality First</h4>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">We believe that free doesn't mean compromised quality. Our calculators use the same rigorous mathematical formulas and validation processes as premium software. Every tool undergoes extensive testing to ensure accuracy and reliability.</p>
                    
                    <h4 style="color: #667eea; margin-bottom: 15px;">Privacy by Design</h4>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">User privacy isn't an afterthought ‚Äì it's built into the foundation of our tools.

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Our tools are designed by understanding real user needs, not just technical possibilities. We prioritize clarity, ease of use, and practical functionality over complex features that add confusion without value.</p>
                    
                    <h4 style="color: #667eea; margin-bottom: 15px;">Continuous Improvement</h4>
