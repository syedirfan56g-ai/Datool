            <h2 style="color: #667eea; margin-bottom: 30px;">Quality Tools Without the Price Tag</h2>
            
            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px; font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7;">At Datools, we believe that high-quality educational and financial tools should be accessible to everyone, regardless of economic circumstances. Our commitment to providing free calculators stems from our mission to democratize access to professional-grade computational tools that can enhance learning, improve financial decision-making, and support academic and professional success.</p>

                <h3 style="color: #764ba2; margin-bottom: 20px;">ðŸ†“ Why We're Free</h3>
                <div style="background: #f8f9fa; padding: 25px; border-radius: 15px; margin-bottom: 30px;">
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Many online calculator services charge monthly subscriptions, limit functionality behind paywalls, or bombard users with intrusive advertisements. We've chosen a different path. Our calculators are completely free to use, with no registration requirements, no hidden fees, and no artificial limitations on functionality.</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">We believe that students preparing for AP exams shouldn't have to pay premium prices for score calculators. Similarly, families trying to understand living wage requirements or individuals planning loan strategies shouldn't face financial barriers to accessing accurate computational tools. Our free model ensures that quality educational and financial resources are available to everyone.</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">This approach not only serves our community mission but also reflects our confidence in the quality of our tools. We don't need to hide functionality behind paywalls because we've built something genuinely valuable that stands on its own merits.</p>
                    
                    <p>By keeping our tools free, we enable teachers to incorporate them into lesson plans without budget constraints, help students access resources regardless of their financial situation, and support individuals in making better financial decisions without additional costs.</p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Being free doesn't mean compromising on privacy or security. Our calculators perform all computations locally in your browser, meaning your sensitive financial information never leaves your device. We don't collect personal data, track usage patterns, or store calculation results.</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">This client-side approach not only protects your privacy but also ensures faster calculations and the ability to use our tools even without a constant internet connection once the page loads.</p>
                    
                    <p>We believe that privacy is a fundamental right, not a premium feature, and our free tools reflect this philosophy by protecting user data while delivering exceptional functionality.</p>
